This means building platforms and registers others can build upon, providing resources (like APIs) that others can use, and linking to the work of others. We should concentrate on the irreducible core.\n",

    "The best way to build good services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release [Minimum Viable Products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) early, test them with actual users, move from [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) to [Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta) to Live adding features, deleting things that don’t work and making refinements based on feedback. Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons. If a prototype isn’t working, don’t be afraid to scrap it and start again.\n",
